We want the app to:
Let you log an exercise (e.g., "Squats", 3 sets, 10 reps, targets "Legs").
Store this data and group it by muscle group.
Show totals like "Legs: 3 sets, 30 reps" when requested.
A simple data structure could be a dictionary where:
Keys are muscle groups (e.g., "Legs", "Chest", "Back").
Values are lists of exercises with sets and reps.
Step 3: Core Features
Feature 1: Input Exercises
The app should prompt you for:
Exercise name.
Number of sets.
Number of reps per set.
Muscle group.
Feature 2: Store Data
Use a dictionary to organize everything. For example:
python
fitness_log = {
    "Legs": [{"name": "Squats", "sets": 3, "reps": 10}],
    "Chest": [{"name": "Bench Press", "sets": 4, "reps": 8}]
}
Feature 3: Display Totals
Calculate and show total sets and reps per muscle group.
Step 4: Replit Decisions
Replit might ask:
Do you want to add packages? For now, no external libraries are needed (pure Python is fine). If you later want a database or UI, Replit might prompt for packages like sqlite3 or flask.
Run Configuration: Stick with the default python main.py command.
File Structure: Start with one file (main.py). Replit may suggest adding more files later—say "yes" if you want to split code (e.g., data.py for storage).
Step 5: Code Example
Here’s a working Python script for main.py. Paste this into Replit and run it:
python
# Fitness Tracker App
fitness_log = {}

def add_exercise():
    name = input("Enter exercise name (e.g., Squats): ")
    sets = int(input("Enter number of sets: "))
    reps = int(input("Enter reps per set: "))
    muscle_group = input("Enter muscle group (e.g., Legs, Chest, Back): ").capitalize()
    
    exercise = {"name": name, "sets": sets, "reps": reps}
    
    if muscle_group in fitness_log:
        fitness_log[muscle_group].append(exercise)
    else:
        fitness_log[muscle_group] = [exercise]
    print(f"Added {name} to {muscle_group}.")

def show_totals():
    if not fitness_log:
        print("No exercises logged yet.")
        return
    
    for muscle, exercises in fitness_log.items():
        total_sets = sum(ex["sets"] for ex in exercises)
        total_reps = sum(ex["sets"] * ex["reps"] for ex in exercises)
        print(f"{muscle}: {total_sets} sets, {total_reps} reps")
        for ex in exercises:
            print(f"  - {ex['name']}: {ex['sets']} sets x {ex['reps']} reps")

def main():
    while True:
        print("\n1. Add exercise\n2. Show totals\n3. Exit")
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")
        
        if choice == "1":
            add_exercise()
        elif choice == "2":
            show_totals()
        elif choice == "3":
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How It Works
Run the Code: Click "Run" in Replit. It’ll start in the console.
Add Exercise: Choose option 1, then enter details (e.g., "Squats", 3 sets, 10 reps, "Legs").
Show Totals: Choose option 2 to see something like:
Legs: 3 sets, 30 reps
  - Squats: 3 sets x 10 reps
Exit: Option 3 stops the app.
